   * **IMPORTANT:** \
   * This property is Android specific and will be ignored by iOS native plugin.
   *
   * By default, the SDK will only allow to use Class 3 (formerly strong) sensors.
   * Using Class 2 sensors is less secure and discouraged. When a Class 2 sensor is used, the FIDO
   * UAF keys are not protected by the operating system by requiring user authentication.
   *
   * If the SDK detects that only Class 3 (strong) biometric sensors are available in the mobile
   * device, even if Class 2 sensors are allowed, the FIDO UAF credentials will be protected by
   * the operating system by requiring user authentication.
   *
   * However, in some cases it may be acceptable for the sake of end-user convenience. Allowing
   * Class 2 sensors will enable for instance the use of face recognition in some Samsung devices.
