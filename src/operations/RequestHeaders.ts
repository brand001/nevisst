 * The interface defining the HTTP headers that can be provided to {@link HttpOperation}.
 * The headers can be used for example to correlate multiple operations in the backend:
 * a header with an identifier can be provided to the {@link HttpOperation}, and the header
 * will be included in the HTTP request. If the identifier can be associated with a more general
 * operation (like a user enrollment), the backend will be able to link the requests made by the
 * SDK with that more generic operation.
 *
 * This interface tracks header values line-by-line. A field with multiple comma-separated values
 * on the same line will be treated as a field with a single value by this class.
 * It is the caller's responsibility to detect and split on commas if their field permits multiple
 * values. This simplifies use of single-valued fields whose values routinely contain commas, such
 * as dates.
